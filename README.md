# Drug-Drug-Interaction-Project
As a Pharm D candidate, I built this Python project to automate the detection of Drug-Drug Interactions (DDIs). Using Pandas, I simulate clinical scenarios to identify high-risk combinations like Warfarin &amp; antibiotics. This bridges my clinical background with computational biology to improve medication safety.
